# Monitoring Revenue by Month (Case Study)

## Problem
Physicians want a monthly view of monitoring-related visits and revenue. Data is mixed with non-monitoring visits.

## Approach
- Identify monitoring activity using CPT anchor(s) (example: 99000)
- Filter to monitoring population (patient list) OR CPT logic
- Summarize by Month x CPT
- Produce a pivot-style output for physician review

## Deliverables
- Example dataset (synthetic)
- Example output table
- Notes on how to implement in Excel pivots or SQL
