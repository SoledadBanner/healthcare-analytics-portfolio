# Healthcare Analytics Portfolio — Soledad Banner

## Overview
This repository contains a small, curated set of analytics and AI-adjacent case studies focused on healthcare operations, revenue cycle performance, and documentation/compliance workflows.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate how I approach real-world healthcare data problems — from ambiguous business questions to executive-ready outputs.

## Case Studies

### 1) Monitoring Revenue by Month
**Business Problem**  
Clinical leadership needed visibility into monthly volume and revenue trends for monitored patients, separated from non-monitoring visits.

**Approach**  
- Identify monitoring activity using CPT anchors (e.g., 99000) and/or patient attribution lists  
- Normalize visit data and aggregate by Month × CPT  
- Produce a physician-friendly KPI table and chart for recurring reporting  

**Methods**  
SQL-style logic • Excel (Pivot Tables, XLOOKUP) • Python (pandas) using synthetic data  

**Outputs**  
- Monthly KPI summary table  
- Example pivot layout used for physician and leadership reporting
- **Example Output (Synthetic Data)**

### 2) Patient Experience Survey Reporting
**Business Problem**  
Survey results were difficult for leadership to interpret due to dense charts and mixed question groupings.

**Approach**

- Design clear, executive-ready visuals with readable labels  

**Methods**  
Data cleaning • Visualization logic • PowerPoint-ready outputs  

**Outputs**  
- Slide-ready charts  
- Improved readability and faster executive interpretation
